     postTitle: "5 key features of good training documentation",
      postedDate: "2020-01-25",
      postIntroText: "Often a website receives its content from a CMS, a content management system, that sends blocks of content to a website, which will then display it in manner that meets style guidelines. Training users on using CMSs involved in their work is one of the tasks involved in Managing a website. Here are 5 key qualities that can make for helpful training documentation.",
      heading1: "Tailored",
      paragraph1:"CMSs are often used by various groups of people, each of whom have different roles. One method to help users to understand how to use a system is to provide them with training documents that use examples from their way of working.  As this is within publishing this does mean that you have to understand the workflows of those who work in Editorial, Marketing, Sales and Production to apply what they need most out of a system to the examples shown in your documentation and the learning points you need to communicate. This does mean having to update a lot of training documents, however, it does mean that new users can use documentation that is relevant to their work. ",
      heading2: "Current and accurate",
      paragraph2:"Systems that users rely on are updated routinely and it’s no different for CMSs within publishing. In addition to providing content that is tailored to the user it’s important to keep it up to date, so that users have the most relevant and accurate examples that will help them to complete their work.",
      heading3: "Encourages practice",
      paragraph3:"Training documentation can provide instructions on how to carry out specific tasks but a really helpful feature is if they also encourage the user to step away and practice what they’ve read and use it to create what they need in order to do their work. ",
      heading4: "Consistent and thoughtful layout",
      paragraph4: "A training document can sometimes be overwhelming to read through. One of the ways to manage this is to implement a specific and consistent layout throughout. Having clear visual markers, that are consistent throughout the document makes it easy for the user to understand which bits of information are important for them to understand, which parts of the document hold instructions on steps they need to carry out, which parts of the document hold resources or background information on a topic etc. This can be achieved with simple things like headings, font styles, icons and borders around specific sections of the document.",
      heading5: "Multi-medium",
      paragraph5: "Having more than one medium with which to communicate information is a helpful feature in training documentation. Text is great, but mediums like video, illustrations, images, gifs can also be used to demonstrate examples, showcase a new feature and how it can be used.",
